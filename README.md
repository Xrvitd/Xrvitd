### Hi there 👋

I am a second-year master student at the Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC) of Shandong University. I am under the tutelage of Prof. Changhe Tu and Prof. Shiqing Xin. My research interests are computer graphics, computational geometry, point cloud reconstruction and geometric modeling.

😄I am looking for PhD to start in Fall 2024. Contact me if you have any leads!
